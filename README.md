In the beginning I've bought course and took part in it. In free time I like play in games on console and hanging out with close friends as well. Actually i am interesting and like in travels and willing to persuade other people which never been in another country to visit. It's one of some goals in my life but my main aim is that I would like to work as specialist of testing for my whole life, enjoy and share testing with people.
